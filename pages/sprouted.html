                <p>Sprouted is a project in which I self-imposed the challenge of making the hamburger menu intuitive. During the weeks before starting the project, it seemed as though <strong>nearly every day I would read an article about how horrible the hamburger menu is.</strong></p>
                <p>After many iterations in my sketchbook and a few rough prototypes this is the solution I arrived at. I still try to avoid hamburgers (especially if I'm on a diet) but this project was quite exciting and a great learning experience.</p>
